# Selective-Copy
A simple and efficient extension based File Copier
This is basically a File Copier made in Python using Tkinter library, that will be very handy while copying/moving files selectively on the basis of the extension of file.

Imagine a condition where you have downloaded lot of files from the Internet(that includes music, documents, images etc.) and you need to move all music files to one folder, images to other and documents to other. Well, it will be a hectic task to do this and this is where you will need this "Selective-Copy".

The application is now only for windows and it is standalone(that means you don't need to install any dependencies etc.) Just clone/download the project and run the SelectiveCopy.exe and there you go. The application comes with User Friendly GUI. Beside some given extensions in the application you can also write you own list of extension separated by comma(,).
